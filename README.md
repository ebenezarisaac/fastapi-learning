To create a virtual env called venv in a target folder called env
run `python -m venv venv`
You need to activate this newly created environment by running
`source venv/Scripts/activate`. This activates the new virtual env that was created.
Now install packages using pip install commands
eg `pip install fastapi` etc
After you know that you have all packages and ready to generate a requirements.txt file,
run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. This stores all the packages installed via pip into a file called requirements.txt
